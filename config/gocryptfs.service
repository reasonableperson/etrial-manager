# This unit file is part of the etrial package.
#
# If this service is running, the secure part of the filesystem has been
# decrypted, /crypt is available, and the web app will be usable.
#
# If this service is not running, /crypt is not available and the web app will
# prompt the user for the decryption key.
#
# If the user provides the decryption key, the web app will write it to
# /tmp/crypt.key. systemd watches this path, and will start this service when
# it is created.
